# RobotGraph - Maze-Solving Robot

## Project Overview

Graph It is an autonomous robot designed to navigate and solve mazes with black lines. It employs various sensors and algorithms to detect the maze structure, determine the shortest path from the starting point to the finish, and follow this path efficiently.

## Features

- **Maze Solving:** Graph It can analyze and navigate through complex mazes with black lines as paths.

- **Shortest Path Calculation:** The robot uses graph-based algorithms to determine the shortest path from the starting position to the finish.

- **Sensor Integration:** It is equipped with a variety of sensors, including line-following sensors, distance sensors, and possibly camera-based vision systems.

- **Motor Control:** Precise motor control allows Graph It to make accurate movements within the maze.

- **Customizability:** The robot's behavior and algorithms can be customized and fine-tuned for different maze configurations.
